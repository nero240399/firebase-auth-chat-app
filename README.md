# Chatne App

**Chatne** is a simple chat application built with
**[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)**
that allows authenticated Google users
to join a single shared chat room.

## üî• Motivation

This project was initiated to explore Firebase Authentication, WebSocket,
and Push Notifications. Initially focusing on building a basic chat app,
I aim to expand its functionality to include person-to-person chats and
options for connecting users with strangers. This ongoing development journey
is driven by a passion for learning and innovation.
